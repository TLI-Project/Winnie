                <p>Depreciation is the difference between a car's value when you buy it and when you come to sell it.
                    This drop in value varies between makes and models and the depreciation of each model is depicted
                    on the graph for each year of ownership.</p>

                    Amortization describes the process of gradually paying off your auto loan. In an amortizing loan,
                    for each of your monthly payments, a portion is applied towards the amount of the loan – the
                    principal – and a portion of the payment is applied towards paying the finance charge –
                    the interest.</p>
